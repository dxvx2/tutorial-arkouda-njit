# PPoPP 2023 Arkouda Tutorial Documentation

## About Arkouda

Arkouda is an open-source framework created with the intention to facilitate the processing of data at-scale with a interface similar to NumPy. It is powered through a powerful Chapel back end with a simple-to-use Python front end. 

In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how Arkouda can be used not only for typical data analysis, but also explore how it can be used for large-scale grapg analysis. We will show all the steps in a typical data science workflow from data gathering to data cleaning, and ultimately, data visualization.
